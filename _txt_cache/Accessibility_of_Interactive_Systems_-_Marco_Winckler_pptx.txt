Overview of the program 
•False ideas about impairment, disability, and handicap. 
•Social issues and simulations of handicap situations (physical 
limitations, use of a screen reader). 
•Assistive technologies for visual interfaces: responsive design; 
video games accessibility, …
•Accessibility and universal design.

Why Accessibility  ? 
•“Accessibility  is ease of use of a product, a 
service, an environment or a facility, 
regardless of individuals' capabilities .” 
(Standard ISO 9241, 2008). 
•Multiples implications for: 
–Understanding individuals capabilities 
–Design of assistive technology 
–Regulations and laws for making social impact 
Accessibility : False Ideas 
•I am not disabled, therefore this is not for me 
–WAI is for all 
–20% people have some kind of problem 
–Barriers affect several devices: (mobiles, PDA, TV, kiosks, voice response 
systems, ...) 
•Disabled people can't use computers 
–Internet is a great world for them (and for me too) 
–Specialized Hw + Sw (Braille, voice, magnifiers, ...) 
–Other temporal disabilities: driving 
•Boring/dull text-only alternate version 
–Discrimination (not all people have the same problems) 
–Why double effort or resources? 
–A text only version may be even less accessible 
•Specific design for each user type/device 
–Design for ANY  user type 
–Device independence

Situations  affect our abilities 
to interact with technologies, 
our surroundings, and other people. 
18
Situationally induced impairments and disabilities 
(SIID) 
“Both the environment in which individuals are 
working and their current [activities] … can 
contribute to the existence of impairments, 
disabilities, and handicaps.” 
19Andrew Sears & 
Mark Young (2003) 
Disability (WHO 1976) 
“Any restriction or lack … of ability to perform 
an activity in the manner or within the range 
considered normal  for a human being .”
 — World Health Organization (1976) 
20DEPRECATED

Disability due to the environment 
has been recognized for some time 
in the accessibility community.

22
Disabling situations 
“[A soldier on a battlefield] can be blinded by smoke, deafened 
by gunfire, mobility impaired by being up to the waist in mud, 
have poor tactile sensitivity and dexterity because of wearing a 
chemical warfare suit, and be cognitively impaired because of 
being scared stiff of being killed—and this is before the solider is 
wounded! If one were to measure the effective abilities of a 
person in such an environment , they would be poor enough 
over a number of dimensions for him or her to be classified as 
severely disabled in a more normal environment.” 
23Alan F. Newell (1995) 
24
Don’t need to be a soldier to experience a 
disabling situations 
Environments affect our ability to interact. 
We adapt ourselves to compensate. 
25
Assistive technology 
26

Our computing devices remain 
oblivious  to the many ways we adapt 
ourselves to suit them. 
27
Accessible computing? Or adaptable 
humans? 
28

Assistive technology, a few examples 
29

Since environments affect all of us, 
we all might beneﬁt  from more 
situationally aware devices. 
30
Accessibility is for everyone 
31“If we design systems which are truly ubiquitous and nomadic; that we can 
use whether we are walking down the hall, driving the car, sitting at our 
workstation, or sitting in a meeting; that we can use when we’re under stress 
or distracted; and that make it easy for us to locate and use new services—we 
will have created systems which are accessible to almost anyone with a 
physical or sensory disability. … [D]ifferent environments will put 
constraints on the type of physical and sensory input and output techniques 
that will work. … [M]ost all of the issues around providing access to people 
with disabilities will be addressed if we simply address the issues raised by 
[this] ‘range of environments.’” 
Gregg C. Vanderheiden (1997) 
Not “the same!” 
32•Different lived experience 
•No stigma with SIIDs 
•No disability culture 
•No need for legal protections 
or policy considerations 
And yet… 
•The impairing effects of SIIDs are real 
•Designs that can benefit people with 
disabilities can also benefit people 
experiencing SIIDs

Many sources of SIIDs

What is universal design? 
Universal Design is the design of all 
products and environments to be usable 
by people of all ages and abilities, to the 
greatest extent possible. 
- Ronald L. Mace, 1991 

"The only important thing about design is 
how it relates to people.” 
(Pananek, 1968) 
“The only thing 
important about 
design is how it 
relates to people.” 
Victor Papanek, 1968 

Tales of universal design in Industry 

Duracell hearing aid batteries 
Packaging that reduces 
effort is as important 
to usability as the 
product itself. 

Oxo Good Grips 
Sometimes universal 
design markets itself. 

Tupperware 
Products that last 
through several 
generations should 
be usable by people 
of all ages and 
abilities.

disabilities

people with disabilities

1. Equitable Use 
2. Flexibility in Use 
3. Simple and Intuitive Use 
4. Perceptible Information 
5. Tolerance for Error 
6. Low Physical Effort 
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use The 7 Principles of Universal Design 
Principle 1:  Equitable Use 
The design is useful and marketable 
to people with diverse abilities. 
 

Principle 1: Equitable Use 

Principle 2:  Flexibility in Use 
The design accommodates a wide range of individual 
preferences and abilities. 

Principle 2:  Flexibility in Use 

Principle 3:  Simple and Intuitive Use 
Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the 
user’s experience, knowledge, language skills or 
concentration. 

Principle 3:  Simple and Intuitive Use 

Principle 4:  Perceptible Information 
The design communicates information effectively to the 
user, regardless of the environment or the user’s 
abilities 

Principle 4:  Perceptible Information 

Principle 5:  Tolerance for Error 
The design minimizes hazards and negative 
consequences of accidental actions. 

Principle 5:  Tolerance for Error 
The design minimizes hazards and negative 
consequences of accidental actions. 
“CAUTION:  It is not recommended that children or pets 
regularly drink water from the toilet, even though the bowl 
water is not harmful to children or pets.” 

Principle 6:  Low Physical Effort 
The design can be used efficiently 
and comfortably and with a 
minimum of fatigue. 

Principle 6:  Low Physical Effort 
The design can be used efficiently 
and comfortably and with a 
minimum of fatigue. 

Principle 7:  Size and Space for 
Approach and Use 
Appropriate size and space is provided for use, regardless of 
user’s body size or posture.

Baby Boomers 
•Extended careers 
•Active lifestyles 
•½ are sandwiched 
between children and 
parents 

Seniors 
•Most rapid growth worldwide 
•Desire to age in place 
•Most caregivers are females 
over 75 
•Rising number care for 
grandchildren 

Why Accessibility  and Universal  Design  ?
•People autonomies makes life easier for all! 
•We always might have hard time in life 
•As the winter... aging is coming … 
•Making money 
•So we all concerned
